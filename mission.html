            <p class="static-pcenter">PandeMICs! is created with love by the University of New Haven (UNHcFREG at the Samuel S. Bergami Jr. Cybersecurity Center). Our mission is during uncertain times of outbreaks and calls from our government(s) to practice social distancing to still allow our communities to communicate with one another. We empower your voice by allowing you to share information about suspected cases, local store supplies, and local testing facilities to stand together as a community and overcome hard times.</p>
