            <p class="static-pcenter">PandeMICs! wants to help connect the world during times of disease and outbreak. Through the use of technology we provide real-time statistics from vetted government agencies to help you carry on during your daily lives. Our goal is to leverage crowd sourced information to let our users know where suspected infectious disease cases are, what local stores have supplies, and where they can go to get tested through a powerful upvote/downvote system. Take the MIC out of PandeMICs! and be a voice for your community. </p>
